# run this code concurrently with the other code that scrolls reels? 
# we could use this topic classifier for our agent to choose what to watch

# i am going to have to implement selenium to download the thumbnails from the reels
# then i'll need to get the downloaded tn into the gpt4-o request, maybe by link
  # if I need the link, i'll likely upload to aws s3 which would take a bit of effort and $0.00Xs

# one issue that could come up is the runtime, if i want to make decisions with it
# ie: should it continue watching the video or not? (if these are the topic it seeks)
# given that the code may take 5s to execute, it could skew our watch times.
